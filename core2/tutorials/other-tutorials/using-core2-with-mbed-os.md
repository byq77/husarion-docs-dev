**Mbed OS** is free, open-source platform and embedded operating system designed for IoT devices based on Arm Cortex-M family of microcontrollers. It is developed as collaborative project by *Arm*, its partners and growing community of individual devs from across the world. Mbed OS is distributed under the [Apache-2.0 License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License) and it's available on project's GitHub page : https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os.

Besides support for hundreds of boards from different manufacturers the framework has following features:
* built-in support for connectivity options like *Bluetooth LE*, *Wi-Fi*, *Ethernet*, *Cellular*, *LoRa LPWAN*, *NFC* and others,
* RTOS core based on open-source *CMSIS-RTOS RTX* (it is also possible to build projects without it),
* Hardware Enforced and Communications Security.

You can learn more about Mbed OS on its [official webpage](https://www.mbed.com/en/platform/mbed-os/).

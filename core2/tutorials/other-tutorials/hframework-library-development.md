# hFramework library development #

If you like to develop [hFramework](https://github.com/husarion/hFramework) together with our Community, or to adapt it to your purposes, this is a way how to do it.

## Preparation ##

You need to collect all required software.

If you using Windows:

Install Chocolatey following this guide: https://chocolatey.org/install

After Chocolatey installation, in the same terminal type: `choco install git` and follow the instructions. It will automatically install Git for Windows.

For all operating systems:

Open Visual Studio Code and install "Husarion" extension in VSC ([Ctrl]+[Shift]+[X] and find "Husarion") if you have not done this before.
			
## Cloning hFramework repository ##

Press [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[P] and type `Git: Clone`, then type `https://github.com/husarion/hFramework.git`, then specify the destination folder, e.g. `C:\Husarion`.

Next you have to open this repository by clicking `File -> Open Folder...` and chose for example `C:\Husarion\hFramework`. 

Then press [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[P] and type `Git: Checkout to...`, choose `origin/devel`. The access to master branch is limited but you can work with devel branch.

## hFramework sourcecode compilation ##

1. Open a terminal in VSCode and enter following commands:

	**if you use cmd.exe:**
	```
	del CMakeCache.txt
	del build.ninja
	mkdir build\stm32_core2_1.0.0
	cd build\stm32_core2_1.0.0
	set PATH=%PATH%;%HOMEPATH%\.vscode\HusarionTools\bin
	cmake ../.. -DBOARD_TYPE=core2 -DPORT=stm32 -DHFRAMEWORK_PATH=. -GNinja
	ninja
	```
	
	**if you use bash (Windows & mingw - eg. gitforwindows.org):**
	```
	rm CMakeCache.txt
	rm build.ninja
	mkdir build
	cd build
	mkdir stm32_core2_1.0.0
	cd stm32_core2_1.0.0
	export PATH="$PATH:$HOMEPATH/.vscode/HusarionTools/bin"
	cmake ../.. -DBOARD_TYPE=core2 -DPORT=stm32 -DHFRAMEWORK_PATH=. -GNinja
	ninja
	```
	
	**if you use bash (Linux):**
	```
	rm CMakeCache.txt
	rm build.ninja
	mkdir build
	mkdir build/stm32_core2_1.0.0
	cd build/stm32_core2_1.0.0
	export PATH="$PATH:$HOMEPATH/.vscode/HusarionTools/bin"
	cmake ../.. -DBOARD_TYPE=core2 -DPORT=stm32 -DHFRAMEWORK_PATH=. -GNinja
	ninja
	```
	Compiler should run and create static library for hFramework. After a while, you shall see the following output on the terminal:

## Using the library compiled by yourself ##
     
1. Create a new folder for your project.
2. In VSCode File -> Open Folder

	![image](/assets/img/howToStart/com_p2.png)

3. In the opened window find the directory you just created. Project tree should be empty.
4. Press [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[P]. Small console will open on the top.

5. Type “Create Husarion project” and press Enter to accept.
6. In the project tree you should find files like on this screenshot:

	![image](/assets/img/howToStart/com_p5.png)

7. Before the first build you have to comment some modules (remember to save "ctrl + s"). 
Open CMakeLists.txt and comment the lines: 

```
#enable_module(hCloudClient)
#enable_module(hSensors)
#enable_module(hModules)
#enable_module(hROS)`
```

8. Press [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[P], type “Change Husarion project variable” and press [Enter].
9. Type “HFRAMEWORK_PATH” and press [Enter].
10. Type or copy the path to hFramework directory. Remember to use "/", not "\". Example:
```
C:/Husarion/hFramework
```
11. Press [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[B] to build your project. If everything goes well, no message should pop up and in project tree you should find tree new output files:
```
myproject.bin
myproject.elf
myproject.hex
```	
	**That means you have successfully built your first project, together with hFramework sources.**
12. In next step find folder `tools` in your `.vscode\extensions\husarion.husarion-1.5.6\sdk` directory, and copy this folder to hFramework repository that you cloned from git, e.g. `C:/Husarion/hFramework`.
13. To program CORE2 via USB, click [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[P] and select "Flash project to CORE2". Make sure that you replaced USB driver for your CORE2 to the "WinUSB (v6.1.7600.16385)" using [Zadig](https://husarion.com/core2/tutorials/howtostart/offline-development-tools/#offline-development-tools-installation-guide).

P.S. To get back to the previous version of the USB driver you need to open "device manager" in Windows and uninstall USB connection associated with FTDI/CORE2, together with the driver for this device (tick the checkbox). In uninstallation confirmation windows select a checkbox to uninstall the driver and click OK.

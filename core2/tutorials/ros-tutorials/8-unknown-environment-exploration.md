# Unknown environment exploration #

## Introduction ##

Environment exploration task is to determine robot desired positions in
such a sequence which gives as much information regarding environment as
possible. One of the approaches for this task is to frontiers of
occupancy grid. As a frontier we define line between free space ant
territory marked as unknown. Moving towards frontiers, unknown area can
be explored and marked as free or occupied and frontiers are moved into
an unknown territory. Process is repeated until all frontiers are
investigated, this means free area must be surrounded by occupied cells.

## Environment exploration in ROS ##

In ROS it is possible to explore environment with use of occupancy grid
frontiers. One of the nodes, that perform this task is `explore_server`
node from `frontier_exploration` package. This node uses occupancy grid
e.g. created by `slam_gmapping` and publishes goal position to
`/move_base/goal` topic subscribed by path planner e.g. `move_base`
node.

### Requirements regarding robot ###

Before continuing with `explore_server` node certain requirements must
be met, robot should:

-   subscribe `/move_base/goal` topic with message type
    `geometry_msgs/PoseStamped` in which robot desired positions are
    included.

-   Publish map to `/map` topic with message type
    `nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid`

Above configuration is met by the robot created in previous manual.

Moreover, we will use `explore_client` node from `frontier_exploration`
package, this will make easier to define exploration area through
`rviz`.

### Configuration of `explore_server` node ###


Based on occupancy grid, `explore_server` node determines frontiers
between free and unknown area and using them determines robot
destinations. It is necessary to define some parameters for
`explore_server` before running it.

Begin with robot outline, transform tolerance, update and publish
frequency, map coordinate frame name, robot coordinate frame name,
resolution and define if map should follow position of robot, these
parameters have the same meaning as for trajectory planning:

    footprint: [[0.12, 0.14], [0.12, -0.14], [-0.12, -0.14], [-0.12, 0.14]]
    transform_tolerance: 5
    update_frequency: 5
    publish_frequency: 5
    global_frame: map
    robot_base_frame: base_link

Define what kind of map layers to use:

    plugins: 
        - {name: static,           type: "costmap_2d::StaticLayer"}
        - {name: explore_boundary, type: "frontier_exploration::BoundedExploreLayer"}
        - {name: inflation,        type: "costmap_2d::InflationLayer"}

Parameters for static map layer, map topic name and define if map can
change:

    static:
        map_topic: /map
        subscribe_to_updates: true

Parameters for exploration boundaries layer:

    explore_boundary:
        resize_to_boundary: false
        frontier_travel_point: "middle"
        explore_clear_space: false

Parameters meaning:

-   `resize_to_boundary` - Defines if cost map should be resized to
    boundaries of search region.

-   `frontier_travel_point` - While defining next destination, which
    fragment of frontier to choose, could be `closest` to robot,
    `middle` of frontier or `centroid` of all frontier points.

-   `explore_clear_space` - Defines if exploration node should explore
    space marked as clear or only unknown space.

Parameters for obstacles inflation layer, define inflation radius:

    inflation:
        inflation_radius: 0.5

Your final file should look like below:

```
footprint: [[0.12, 0.14], [0.12, -0.14], [-0.12, -0.14], [-0.12, 0.14]]
transform_tolerance: 5
update_frequency: 5
publish_frequency: 5
global_frame: map
robot_base_frame: base_link

plugins: 
    - {name: static,           type: "costmap_2d::StaticLayer"}
    - {name: explore_boundary, type: "frontier_exploration::BoundedExploreLayer"}
    - {name: inflation,        type: "costmap_2d::InflationLayer"}

static:
    map_topic: /map
    subscribe_to_updates: true
explore_boundary:
    resize_to_boundary: false
    frontier_travel_point: "middle" 
    explore_clear_space: false
inflation:
    inflation_radius: 0.5
```

Save it as `exploration.yaml` in `tutorial_pkg/config` directory.

### Launching exploration task ###

To test above configuration you will need to run `explore_server` node
with nodes from path planning configuration.

To remind, you will need to run following nodes:

-   `CORE2` bridge node -
    `/opt/husarion/tools/rpi-linux/ros-core2-client /dev/ttyCORE2 `

-   `rplidarNode` - driver for rpLidar laser scanner

-   `drive_controller_node` - `tf` publisher for transformation of robot
    relative to starting point

Or instead ot these three, `Gazebo`:

-   `roslaunch rosbot_gazebo maze_world.launch`

And: 

-   `static_transform_publisher` - `tf` publisher for transformation of
    laser scanner relative to robot

-   `slam_gmapping` - map building node

-   `move_base` - trajectory planner

-   `explore_server` - exploration task

-   `explore_client` - node for defining exploration area

-   `rviz` - visualization tool

For the `explore_server` node you will need to specify some parameters
and paths for `.yaml` configuration files:

``` launch
    <node pkg="frontier_exploration" type="explore_server" name="explore_server" output="screen">
        <param name="frequency" type="double" value="1.0"/>
        <param name="goal_aliasing" type="double" value="0.5"/>
        <rosparam ns="explore_costmap" subst_value="true" file="$(find tutorial_pkg)/config/exploration.yaml" command="load" />
    </node>
```

Parameter `frequency` defines how often new goal should be recalculated
and `goal_aliasing` defines last goal and new goal before it is
published to trajectory planner.

You can use below `launch` file:

``` launch
<launch>

    <arg name="use_rosbot" default="true"/>
    <arg name="use_gazebo" default="false"/>

    <include if="$(arg use_gazebo)" file="$(find rosbot_gazebo)/launch/maze_world.launch"/>
    <include if="$(arg use_gazebo)" file="$(find rosbot_gazebo)/launch/rosbot.launch"/>

    <param if="$(arg use_gazebo)" name="use_sim_time" value="true"/>

    <node if="$(arg use_rosbot)" pkg="rplidar_ros" type="rplidarNode" name="rplidar">
        <param name="angle_compensate" type="bool" value="true"/>
    </node>

    <node if="$(arg use_rosbot)" pkg="tutorial_pkg" type="drive_controller_node" name="drive_controller"/>

    <node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="laser_broadcaster" args="0 0 0 3.14 0 0 base_link laser_frame 100" />

    <node pkg="rviz" type="rviz" name="rviz"/>

    <node pkg="gmapping" type="slam_gmapping" name="gmapping">
        <param name="base_frame" value="base_link"/>
        <param name="odom_frame" value="odom" />
        <param name="delta" value="0.1" />
    </node>

    <node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" name="move_base" output="screen">
        <param name="controller_frequency" value="10.0"/>
        <rosparam file="$(find tutorial_pkg)/config/costmap_common_params.yaml" command="load" ns="global_costmap" />
        <rosparam file="$(find tutorial_pkg)/config/costmap_common_params.yaml" command="load" ns="local_costmap" />
        <rosparam file="$(find tutorial_pkg)/config/local_costmap_params.yaml" command="load" />
        <rosparam file="$(find tutorial_pkg)/config/global_costmap_params.yaml" command="load" />
        <rosparam file="$(find tutorial_pkg)/config/trajectory_planner.yaml" command="load" />
    </node>

    <node pkg="frontier_exploration" type="explore_client" name="explore_client" output="screen"/>

    <node pkg="frontier_exploration" type="explore_server" name="explore_server" output="screen">
        <param name="frequency" type="double" value="1.0"/>
        <param name="goal_aliasing" type="double" value="0.5"/>
        <rosparam ns="explore_costmap" subst_value="true" file="$(find tutorial_pkg)/config/exploration.yaml" command="load" />
    </node>

</launch>
```

### Setting the exploration area ###

The easiest way to set exploration area is to use `rviz`. Go to it and
add some objects to visualize:

-   `/scan/LaserScan`

-   `/map/Map`

-   `/exploration_polygon_marker/Marker` - this will help you with
    defining exploration area

-   `/explore_server/explore_costmap/costmap/Map` - this will show area
    to explore

-   `/explore_server/explore_costmap/explore_boundary/frontiers/PointCloud2`
    - this will show frontiers found in the area

You can also add `Tf` visualization, but it is not necessary for proper
operation.

![image](/assets/img/ros/man_8_1.png)

From toolbar select `Publish Point` button and click in visualization
window, this will be first corner of exploration area, select
`Publish Point` button again and choose second corner of exploration
area, they will be connected by blue line. Continue until desired area
is surrounded by lines.

![image](/assets/img/ros/man_8_2.png)

To finish defining exploration region set last point at the position of
first corner, line will become red.

![image](/assets/img/ros/man_8_3.png)

You need to use `Publish Point` button for the last time, click anywhere
inside region and exploration task will start.

Robot will explore all accessible location within selected area. Observe
as robot explores area, when there are no more frontiers or frontiers
are not accessible due to obstacles, robot will stop and exploration
task is considered as done.

## Summary ##

After completing this tutorial you should be able to configure
`explore_server` node to find frontiers on occupancy grid map and set
goals for trajectory planner to explore all unknown area, visualize
frontiers found on the map and finally set exploration area using rviz.

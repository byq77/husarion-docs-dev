# ROS Tutorials #

"The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms." - according to the official [ROS webpage](http://www.ros.org/about-ros/).

We prepared a set of tutorials to help you start building advanced robots. They are prepared to work with Husarion CORE2-ROS controller but they are also a valuable portion of knowledge for anybody interested in ROS.
